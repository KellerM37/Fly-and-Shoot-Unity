# Fly-and-Shoot-Unity
Here we go again!
<br>I spent a little bit of time writing a small game in python after going through a small portion of a course on boot.dev. Through those courses, I built an asteroids clone (which can be found on my github, with slight modifications that go beyond the scope of the course) and decided I had learned enough in a structured way, to start trying to build my own little things, as a learning excercise.
<br>After about a month of working on the weekends, I had completed everything I had originally set out to do. During that time, however, I realized "If I'm going to make games, python ain't the way to go".
<br>So what did I decide to do?
<br><br>**Let's make the same game, but in c#!**<br>
# Controls
W,A,S,D or arrow keys for movement<br>
B for bombs<br>
Space for shoot
